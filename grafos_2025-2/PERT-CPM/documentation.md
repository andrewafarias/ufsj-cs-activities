# DOCUMENTATION
This program implements PERT/CPM following most object-oriented practices. The first line of input contains two integers: the number of vertices and the number of edges pertaining to the graph in which PERT/CPM will be applied. The output will consist of all vertices states, followed by the vertices that compose the critical path in index order.
